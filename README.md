To re-generate the figures and tables presented in the paper, run `scripts/gen_paper_results.py`. This file uses the pre-built Bayesian model files and regression dataset.

To re-generate the main dataset for the paper, run `scripts/create_regression_dataset.py`.

To run Bayesian model sampling, run `scripts/tfp_bayes_yfe_cre_for_drought_full.py`. Note that this is a long running script as Bayesian sampling must complete. Samples will be scaled to facilitate the sampler, and thus the output cannot be directly interpreted. See code block starting at line 96 of `scripts/gen_paper_results.py` for unscaling routine.
